## About me

### Becoming a web developer
Computers have always been a part of my life. My father has been using computers as an AD for ages, so I have been involved in a way or another. Actually, he owns an ad agency, at which I used to hang out quite often as a kid. I remember playing around with software like Adobe Photoshop every now and then. The enthusiasm towards computers raise to a point of no return, when I created my first website on my father's old MacBook. I was twelve or something.

I have been very passionate to express myself through digital creations. Web development has formed as my primary field of interest among graphic design. Brainstorming ideas and solutions and making them alive in the digital domain is what I really love to do. However, I often get excited in new fields and techs. For example, electronic music production is one of my hobbies.

As a developer, making people's life easier keeps me going. Being versatile in what I do is a huge motivator which also enables you to thing big. However, people keep me evolving and make me exceed myself. I think that the main point of software is to contribute to the evolution of modern society and make this world go forward one innovation at a time.

### Graduation from University
I have always self-learned various skills and technologies, but studies have helped me to reach a higher level of thinking. I graduated from the *University of Tampere in 2014 from Computer Science (software development)*. My minor was hypermedia, because of my interest in digital media. My master's thesis ["Fighting Technical Debt: Enabling Sustainable Productivity"](http://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/96566/gradu07218.pdf?sequence=1) discusses about technical debt and its relation to quality, productivity and business.

### Hobbies
I'm some level tech-enthusiast, so it's natural to say that computers are a hobby of mine. Of course, computers are the most important devices in the household. Assembling PCs from components, overclocking, troubleshooting hardware and software issues, and such things have gotten very familiar over the years. I absolutely hate buying market PCs (MacBooks excluded).

In addition to tech, I absolutely can't live without sports, at least at this age. Gym training keeps the body in shape and compensates the passive working habits. I enjoy my portion of cardio through mountain biking and running. I have also played baseball, badminton and bass guitar (not so sporty thing) when I was young, but those hobbies haven been in my agenda nowadays. Although, I have thought about starting some team sport or something later on.


## On development

I thought I start writing some core thoughts about software development in here. When I have the time and mood for writing I add and iterate this section forward.

### It's all about people
Functionality and usability are two quality characteristics that come up to my mind when I think about the goal of software from user's perspective. I seek these qualities from any software that I use, because any software should improve workflow and productivity. When using any application, I often find myself brainstorming improvements related to these qualities. Feedback is generally an important part of development, because the end-users are the ones benefiting from it.

Of course, there are other qualities as well that are really important, such as security, safety or availability. These characteristics are often more under the hood and emerge to users when things go wrong. Users expect quality from the software and the software requires quality people to craft them. Obviously, people are also the ones creating the processes, so it all comes to the quality and synergy of the people.

On the technical side of software, I respect maintainability a lot &mdash; *just because "technical debt" sucks and kills your productivity.* Software architecture is very difficult in general and involves a lot of tricky decisions. Guidelines and conventions makes you pull your hair when you just aren't sure how, why and where. By keeping source code clean and flexible it is easier to make changes. After all, software development is all about change.
